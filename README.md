# Contact_Map_Protein
    func_pdb_to_contact_map: Calculates contact map for a protein from a PDB file.
    
    Inputs:
    - pdbid: PDB file name (e.g., '2ci2.pdb').
    - non_bonded_bondlength: Threshold distance for two residues to be considered in contact.
    
    Output:
    - native_contact_map: Contact map matrix.
